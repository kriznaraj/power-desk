Problem Statement:

Customersâ€™ have bad experiences because of delayed resolution of their issues.Bad customer experience directly affects organisation reputation. Support team has to do a lot of tedious and repetitive work for different customers which eats up a lot of bandwidth and they fail to work efficiently on priority issues due to context switching, understanding gaps, lack of knowledge base or unaware about where to look for documentation.
Again a new support person joins the team, unaware about process, flow, documentation have to apply a lot of effort to understand the system completely.

What if we have something which will clearly tell support agents 

Where to look for ?

What to look for ?

What is critical ?

What is the root cause ?

How to troubleshoot ?

What is the recommended fix ?

Easy onboarding of new Support Agents.

Think about how a happy and efficient support team can improve customer experience to the next level as Support Agents are the point of contact for all customers.



Solution :

Our product PowerDesk is trying to give answers for all the above questions. Overall it will be a 360 degree suite for the Support Team and ultimately a tool which will result in wonderful customer experience.

What PowerDesk do:

Continuously Monitor Logs

Collect and showcase all the issues from logs

Visualise all the collected issues on Dashboard

Dashboard tells Support Agent to what are critical issues, domains, modules

So now they know which issues they need to work on first

Trigger emails to customer/agents in case of something require immediate attention

(All above things done proactively, without the knowledge of customers, this will reduce customer reported issues and customers have to less worry about issues)

PowerDesk help support agent in troubleshooting issues, by having rule engine for figuring out root cause of issue

Also providing them recommended fix

Redirects them to proper knowledge base

Support Agents can define their own definitions and rules to execute as per new error/issues they encountered

So it is like continuously improving product
